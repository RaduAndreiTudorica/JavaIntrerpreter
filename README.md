A tree-walk interpreter for the **Lox** programming language, built in Java following the book *[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)* by Robert Nystrom.

## Current Progress
**Chapter 11: Resolving and Binding**
The interpreter now includes a semantic analysis pass (Resolver) that resolves variable bindings before execution, fixing closure semantics and enabling static error detection.

### Features implemented so far:
- Scanning, parsing, and tree-walk interpretation
- Variables, scopes, and block environments
- Control flow: `if`, `while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`
- Functions, closures, and recursion
- Lambda expressions (with and without braces)
- **Resolver** for static variable resolution and closure correctness
- **Unused variable detection** (reports error for unused local variables)
- **Index-based environment lookup** for faster variable access

## Architecture

The project follows a classic interpreter pipeline:

1. **Scanner (`Scanner.java`)**
    - Converts raw source code into a stream of `Token`s.
    - Handles keywords, literals, and operators.

2. **Parser (`Parser.java`)**
    - **Recursive Descent Parser** that constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    - Handles operator precedence, error synchronization, and statement parsing.

3. **AST (`Expr.java`, `Stmt.java`)**
    - Represents the code structure (expressions and statements).
    - Uses the **Visitor Pattern** for operations like printing (`AstPrinter`) and evaluation (`Interpreter`).

4. **Resolver (`Resolver.java`)**
    - Performs a static analysis pass over the AST before execution.
    - Resolves each variable to its exact scope depth and index.
    - Detects errors such as `return` outside functions, `break`/`continue` outside loops, and unused local variables.

5. **Interpreter (`Interpreter.java`)**
    - Traverses the AST recursively to execute code.
    - Uses pre-resolved variable locations for correct and efficient lookup.

6. **Environment (`Environment.java`, `GlobalEnvironment.java`)**
    - Local environments use an index-based `List<Object>` for fast variable access.
    - Global environment uses a `Map<String, Object>` for named variable lookup.
